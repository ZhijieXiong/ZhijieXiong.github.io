            "abstract": "Online education, which educates students that cannot be present at school, has become an important supplement to traditional education. Without the direct supervision and instruction of teachers, online education is always concerned with potential distractions and misunderstandings. Learning Style Classification (LSC) is proposed to analyze the learning behavior patterns of online learning users, based on which personalized learning paths are generated to help them learn and maintain their interests.\nExisting LSC studies rely on expert-labored labeling, which is infeasible in large-scale applications, so we resort to unsupervised classification techniques. However, current unsupervised classification methods are not applicable due to two important challenges: C1) the unawareness of the LSC problem formulation and pedagogy domain knowledge; C2) the absence of any supervision signals. In this paper, we give a formal definition of the unsupervised LSC problem and summarize the domain knowledge into problem-solving heuristics (which addresses C1). A rule-based approach is first designed to provide a tentative solution in a principled manner (which addresses C2). On top of that, a novel Deep Unsupervised Classifier with domain Knowledge (DUCK) is proposed to convert the discovered conclusions and domain knowledge into learnable model components (which addresses both C1 and C2), which significantly improves the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. Extensive offline experiments on both public and industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods. Moreover, the proposed methods are now deployed in the Huawei Education Center, and the ongoing A/B testing results verify the effectiveness.",

Recent advancements in these systems have notably improved the personalization of course recommendations. However, many existing systems fail to provide clear explanations for their recommendations, making it difficult for learners to understand why a particular suggestion was made. Researchers have emphasized the importance of explanations in various domains such as e-commerce, media, and entertainment, demonstrating how explanations can enhance system transparency, foster user trust, and improve decision-making processes. Despite these insights, such approaches have been rarely applied to the educational domain, and their effectiveness in practical use remains largely unexamined. My research focuses on developing explainable recommender systems for digital education. First, I aim to design knowledge graphs that can support high-quality recommendations in the educational context. Second, I will create models backed by these knowledge graphs that not only deliver accurate recommendations but also provide faithful explanations for each suggestion. Third, I will evaluate the effectiveness of these explainable recommender systems in real-world educational environments.

Although it is well known that modeling the cognitive structure including knowledge level of learners and knowledge structure (e.g., the prerequisite relations) of learning items is important for learning path recommendation, existing methods for adaptive learning often separately focus on either knowledge levels of learners or knowledge structure of learning items. To fully exploit the multifaceted cognitive structure for learning path recommendation, we propose a Cognitive Structure Enhanced framework for Adaptive Learning, named CSEAL. By viewing path recommendation as a Markov Decision Process and applying an actor-critic algorithm, CSEAL can sequentially identify the right learning items to different learners. Specifically, we first utilize a recurrent neural network to trace the evolving knowledge levels of learners at each learning step. Then, we design a navigation algorithm on the knowledge structure to ensure the logicality of learning paths, which reduces the search space in the decision process. Finally, the actor-critic algorithm is used to determine what to learn next and whose parameters are dynamically updated along the learning path.

By presenting learners with a non-linear course format,\nwe encourage them to create their individual learning paths based\non instructor-defined dependencies and their personal interests.\nOur evaluation of flexible learning paths within a programming\nMOOC shows that learners chose many different learning paths.\nDespite achieving similar results in individual tasks compared to\nlearners using the traditional course structure, they engaged with\nless course content, resulting in a slight decrease in their overall per-\nformance.

To perform this task, user proﬁling mechanisms should be implemented to automatically construct and update meaningful user proﬁles. These proﬁles can drive the RS in providing informed recommendations suited to the unique characteristics of each user. In the context of technology enhanced learning (TeL) Recommender Systems, the majority of research focus directly on learners' proﬁling and ignore the potential beneﬁts of proﬁling teachers' professional capacities too. As a result, limited previous works exist on effectively capturing and utilizing individual teachers' particular professional characteristics, such as their Digital Competences (commonly referred to as ICT Competences) and exploiting these in systems that support their teaching preparation and practice, for example in the selection of appropriate educational resources. This paper proposes a RS which targets to support teachers in selecting learning objects (LO) from existing LO repositories (LORs) in a uniﬁed manner, namely by (a) automatically constructing their ICT Competence Proﬁles based on their actions within these LORs and (b) exploiting these proﬁles for more efﬁcient LO selection.

In this paper, we aim to investigate the impact of complementing ERSs with transparent and understandable OLMs that provide justification for their recommendations. We conduct a randomised control trial experiment using an ERS with two interfaces (\"Non-Complemented Interface\" and \"Complemented Interface\") to determine the effect of our approach on student engagement and their perception of the effectiveness of the ERS. Overall, our results suggest that complementing an ERS with an OLM can have a positive effect on student engagement and their perception about the effectiveness of the system despite potentially making the system harder to navigate.

            "abstract": "Educational recommendation seeks to suggest knowledge concepts that match a learner's ability, thus facilitating a personalized learning experience. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have achieved considerable results by taking the encoding of the learner's exercise log as the state and employing an RL-based agent to make suitable recommendations. However, these approaches suffer from handling the diverse and dynamic learner's knowledge states. In this paper, we introduce the privileged feature distillation technique and propose the Privileged Knowledge State Distillation (PKSD) framework, allowing the RL agent to leverage the \"actual\" knowledge state as privileged information in the state encoding to help tailor recommendations to meet individual needs. Concretely, our PKSD takes the privileged knowledge states together with the representations of the exercise log for the state representations during training. And through distillation, we transfer the ability to adapt to learners to a knowledge state adapter. During inference, the knowledge state adapter would serve as the estimated privileged knowledge states instead of the real one since it is not accessible. Considering that there are strong connections among the knowledge concepts in education, we further propose to collaborate the graph structure learning for concepts into our PKSD framework. This new approach is termed GEPKSD (Graph-Enhanced PKSD). As our method is model-agnostic, we evaluate PKSD and GEPKSD by integrating them with five different RL bases on four public simulators, respectively. Our results verify that PKSD can consistently improve the recommendation performance with various RL methods, and our GEPKSD could further enhance the effectiveness of PKSD in all the simulations.",

It becomes more challenging when users cannot devote enough time to learn the entire course. In this paper, we describe two approaches to maximize users' scores for a course while satisfying their time constraints. These approaches recommend successful paths based on the available time and knowledge background of users. We first briefly explain a method that has a similar goal to our method, and highlight its drawbacks. We then describe our proposal, which works based on a two-layered course graph (lesson and Learning Object (LO) layers; a lesson includes a few LO). Initially, our method uses the Depth First Search algorithm (DFS) to find all lesson sequences in the graph that start by a lesson (opted by a user). It then assigns LO for lessons of paths and estimates their score and time. Finally, a path that satisfies the user's limited time while maximizing his/her score is recommended lesson by lesson. During a path recommendation, if the user could not get the estimated score from a lesson, our method recommends auxiliary LO for that lesson. To evaluate our method, we first assessed the quality of our estimation methods and then evaluate our recommender in a live environment. Results show that our estimation methods outperformed the ones in the literature. Results also present within the same amount of time, the users of our recommender proceeded more on the course than the users of another e-learning system.",

By formulating this task as a Markov decision process, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated great power. Although extensive research efforts have been made, previous methods still fail to recommend effective goal-oriented paths due to the under-utilizing of goals. Specifically, it is mainly reflected in two aspects: (1)The lack of goal planning. When learners have multiple goals with different difficulties, the previous methods can't fully utilize the difficulties and dependencies between goal learning items to plan the sequence of achieving these goals, making the path chaotic and inefficient; (2)The lack of efficiency in goal achieving. When pursuing a single goal, the path may contain learning items unrelated to the goal, which makes realizing a certain goal inefficient. To address these challenges, we present a novel Graph Enhanced Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GEHRL) framework for goal-oriented learning path recommendation. The framework divides learning path recommendation into two parts: sub-goal selection(planning) and sub-goal achieving(learning item recommendation). Specifically, we employ a high-level agent as a sub-goal selector to select sub-goals for the low-level agent to achieve. The low-level agent in the framework is to recommend learning items to the learner. To make the path only contain goal-related learning items to improve the efficiency of achieving the goal, we develop a graph-based candidate selector to constrain the action space of the low-level agent based on the sub-goal and knowledge graph. We also develop test-based internal reward for low-level training so that the sparsity problem of external reward can be alleviated.

            "abstract": "The increasing availability of Massive Open Online Courses\n(MOOCs) has created a necessity for personalized course recom-\nmendation systems. These systems often combine neural networks\nwith Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to achieve richer representations of\nlearners and courses. While these enriched representations allow\nmore accurate and personalized recommendations, explainability\nremains a significant challenge which is especially problematic\nfor certain domains with significant impact such as education and\nonline learning. Recently, a novel class of recommender systems\nthat uses reinforcement learning and graph reasoning over KGs\nhas been proposed to generate explainable recommendations in the\nform of paths over a KG. Despite their accuracy and interpretabil-\nity on e-commerce datasets, these approaches have scarcely been\napplied to the educational domain and their use in practice has not\nbeen studied. In this work, we propose an explainable recommen-\ndation system for MOOCs that uses graph reasoning. To validate\nthe practical implications of our approach, we conducted a user\nstudy examining user perceptions of our new explainable recom-\nmendations. We demonstrate the generalizability of our approach\nby conducting experiments on two educational datasets: COCO and\nXuetang.",

            "abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are becoming a modish way for education, which provides a large-scale and open-access learning opportunity for students to grasp the knowledge. To attract students' interest, the recommendation system is applied by MOOCs providers to recommend courses to students. However, as a course usually consists of a number of video lectures, with each one covering some specific knowledge concepts, directly recommending courses overlook students' interest to some specific knowledge concepts. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of knowledge concept recommendation. We propose an end-to-end graph neural network based approach called Attentional Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Deep Knowledge Recommender (ACKRec) for knowledge concept recommendation in MOOCs. Like other recommendation problems, it suffers from sparsity issue. To address this issue, we leverage both content information and context information to learn the representation of entities via graph convolution network. In addition to students and knowledge concepts, we consider other types of entities (e.g., courses, videos, teachers) and construct a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to capture the corresponding fruitful semantic relationships among different types of entities and incorporate them into the representation learning process. Specifically, we use meta-path on the HIN to guide the propagation of students' preferences. With the help of these meta-paths, the students' preference distribution with respect to a candidate knowledge concept can be captured. Furthermore, we propose an attention mechanism to adaptively fuse the context information from different meta-paths, in order to capture the different interests of different students. To learn the parameters of the proposed model, we propose to utilize extended matrix factorization (MF). A series of experiments are conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness of ACKRec across multiple popular metrics compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods. The promising results show that the proposed ACKRec is able to effectively recommend knowledge concepts to students pursuing online learning in MOOCs.",

            "abstract": "People increasingly use online video platforms, e.g., YouTube, to locate educational videos to acquire knowledge or skills to meet personal learning needs. However, most of existing video platforms display video search results in generic ranked lists based on relevance to queries. The design of relevance-oriented information display does not take into account the inner structure of the knowledge domain, and may not suit the need of online learners. In this paper, we present ConceptGuide, a prototype system for learning orientations to support ad hoc online learning from unorganized video materials. ConceptGuide features a computational pipeline that performs content analysis on the transcripts of YouTube videos retrieved for a topic, and generates concept-map-based visual recommendations of inter-concept and inter-video links, forming learning pathways as structures for learners to consume. We evaluated ConceptGuide by comparing the design to the general-purpose interface of YouTube in learning experiences and behaviors. ConceptuGuide was found to improve the efficiency of video learning and helped learners explore the knowledge of interest in many constructive ways.",

            "abstract": "Learning path recommendation (LPR) aims to provide individual-ized and effective learning item routes by modeling learners' learn-ing histories and goals, which has been widely considered a essen-tial task in the field of personalized education. Indeed, considerable research efforts have been dedicated to this direction in recent years, focusing on step-based and sequence-based modeling approaches. However, most of existing studies overlook the complementar-ity between explicit and implicit relationships among knowledge concepts, while failing to harmonize static knowledge structures with dynamic path generation. To this end, in this paper, we pro-pose LIGHT, a knowLedge topology-aware sequence optImization model for enhancing learninG patH recommendaTion. Specifically, we first construct a composite concept graph that incorporates explicit prerequisite relationships and implicit collaborative relationships, achieved by mining interaction statistics and collabo-rative signals from learners' learning processes. Next, we design a complementary contrastive fusion module to fully capture the interplay between the two relational views of concepts through graph structure learning and contrastive constraints, which en-hances the effectiveness of the learned representations. Following this, we introduce a knowledge topology-aware modeling mod-ule that integrates structural semantics clustering with candidate path sampling. Finally, we develop a bidirectional sensing path optimization network to deeply model and optimize the sampled paths from a sequential perspective, thereby enhancing modeling efficiency while preserving structural semantics. Extensive experi-ments on three real-world educational datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LIGHT model in the LPR task.",

            "abstract": "Learning path recommendation aims to provide learners with a reasonable order of items to achieve their learning goals. Intuitively, the learning process on the learning path can be metaphorically likened to walking. Despite extensive efforts in this area, most previous methods mainly focus on the relationship among items but overlook the difficulty of items, which may raise two issues from a real walking perspective: (1) The path may be rough: When learners tread the path without considering item difficulty, it's akin to walking a dark, uneven road, making learning harder and dampening interest. (2) The path may be inefficient: Allowing learners only a few attempts on very challenging items before switching, or persisting with a difficult item despite numerous attempts without mastery, can result in inefficiencies in the learning journey. To conquer the above limitations, we propose a novel method named Difficulty-constrained Learning Path Recommendation (DLPR), which is aware of item difficulty. Specifically, we first explicitly categorize items into learning items and practice items, then construct a hierarchical graph to model and leverage item difficulty adequately. Then we design a Difficulty-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (DHRL) framework to facilitate learning paths with efficiency and smoothness. Finally, extensive experiments on three different simulators demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
