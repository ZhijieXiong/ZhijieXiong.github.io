Existing cognitive\ndiagnosis methods only consider which of knowledge concepts\nare involved in the knowledge components of exercises, but ignore\nthe fact that different knowledge concepts have different effects on\npractice scores in actual learning situations. Therefore, researchers\nneed to reshape the learning scene by combining the multi-factor\nrelationships between knowledge components. In this paper, in\norder to more comprehensively simulate the interaction between\nstudents and exercises, we developed a neural network-based\nCDMFKC model for cognitive diagnosis. Our method not only\ncaptures the nonlinear interaction between exercise characteristics,\nstudent performance, and their mastery of each knowledge concept,\nbut also further considers the impact of knowledge concepts by\ndesigning the difficulty and discrimination of knowledge concepts,\nand uses multiple neural layers to model their interaction so as\nto obtain accurate and interpretable diagnostic results. In addition,\nwe propose an improved CDMFKC model with guessing parameter\nand slipping parameter designed by knowledge concept proficiency\nand student proficiency vectors. We validate the performance of\nthese two diagnostic models on six real datasets.

            "abstract": "Cognitive Diagnosis (CD), which leverages students and exercise data to predict students' proficiency levels on different knowledge concepts, is one of fundamental components in Intelligent Education. Due to the scarcity of student-exercise interaction data, most existing methods focus on making the best use of available data, such as exercise content and student information (e.g., educational context). Despite the great progress, the abuse of student sensitive information has not been paid enough attention. Due to the important position of CD in Intelligent Education, employing sensitive information when making diagnosis predictions will cause serious social issues. Moreover, data-driven neural networks are easily misled by the shortcut between input data and output prediction, exacerbating this problem. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate the negative impact of sensitive information in CD models. In response, we argue that sensitive attributes of students can also provide useful information, and only the shortcuts directly related to the sensitive information should be eliminated from the diagnosis process. Thus, we employ causal reasoning and design a novel Path-Specific Causal Reasoning Framework (PSCRF) to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first leverage an encoder to extract features and generate embeddings for general information and sensitive information of students. Then, we design a novel attribute-oriented predictor to decouple the sensitive attributes, in which fairness-related sensitive features will be eliminated and other useful information will be retained. Finally, we designed a multi-factor constraint to ensure the performance of fairness and diagnosis performance simultaneously. Extensive experiments over real-world datasets (e.g., PISA dataset) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PSCRF.",

            "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis is a fundamental issue of intelligent education platforms, whose goal is to reveal the mastery of students on knowledge concepts. Recently, certain efforts have been made to improve the diagnosis precision, by designing deep neural networks-based diagnostic functions or incorporating more rich context features to enhance the representation of students and exercises. However, how to interpretably infer the student's mastery over non-interactive knowledge concepts (i.e., knowledge concepts not related to his/her exercising records) still remains challenging, especially when not giving relations between knowledge concepts. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Sensed Cognitive Diagnosis (KSCD) framework, aiming at learning intrinsic relations among knowledge concepts from student response logs and incorporating them for inferring students' mastery over all knowledge concepts in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we firstly project students, exercises and knowledge concepts into embedding representation matrices, where the intrinsic relations among knowledge concepts are reflected in the knowledge embedding representation matrix. Then, the knowledge-sensed student knowledge mastery vector and exercise factor vectors are obtained by the multiply product of their embedding representations and the knowledge embedding representation matrix, which make the student's mastery of non-interactive knowledge concepts be interpretably inferred. Finally, we can utilize classical student-exercise interaction functions to predict student's exercising performance and jointly train the model. In additional, we also design a new function to better model the student-exercise interactions. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the significant performance gain of our KSCD framework, especially in predicting students' mastery over non-interactive knowledge concepts, by comparing to state-of-the-art cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs).",

However, existing CDMs often struggle with diagnosing infrequent students and exercises due to a lack of rich prior knowledge. With the advancement in large language models (LLMs), which possess extensive domain knowledge, their integration into cognitive diagnosis presents a promising opportunity. Despite this potential, integrating LLMs with CDMs poses significant challenges. LLMs are not well-suited for capturing the fine-grained collaborative interactions between students and exercises, and the disparity between the semantic space of LLMs and the behavioral space of CDMs hinders effective integration. To address these issues, we propose a novel Knowledge-enhanced Cognitive Diagnosis (KCD) framework, which is a model-agnostic framework utilizing LLMs to enhance CDMs and compatible with various CDM architectures. The KCD framework operates in two stages: LLM Diagnosis and Cognitive Level Alignment. In the LLM Diagnosis stage, both students and exercises are diagnosed to achieve comprehensive and detailed modeling. In the Cognitive Level Alignment stage, we bridge the gap between the CDMs' behavioral space and the LLMs' semantic space using contrastive learning and mask-reconstruction approaches.

            "abstract": "Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) has attracted much research interest due to its strong ability on inferring students' proficiency levels on knowledge concepts. While graph-based CD models have demonstrated remarkable performance, we contend that they still cannot achieve optimal performance due to the neglect of edge heterogeneity and uncertainty. Edges involve both correct and incorrect response logs, indicating heterogeneity. Meanwhile, a response log can have uncertain semantic meanings, e.g., a correct log can indicate true mastery or fortunate guessing, and a wrong log can indicate a lack of understanding or a careless mistake. In this paper, we propose an Informative Semantic-aware Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis model (ISG-CD), which focuses on how to utilize the heterogeneous graph in CD and minimize effects of uncertain edges. Specifically, to explore heterogeneity, we propose a semantic-aware graph neural networks based CD model. To minimize effects of edge uncertainty, we propose an Informative Edge Differentiation layer from an information bottleneck perspective, which suggests keeping a minimal yet sufficient reliable graph for CD in an unsupervised way. We formulate this process as maximizing mutual information between the reliable graph and response logs, while minimizing mutual information between the reliable graph and the original graph. After that, we prove that mutual information maximization can be theoretically converted to the classic binary cross entropy loss function, while minimizing mutual information can be realized by the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Finally, we adopt an alternating training strategy for optimizing learnable parameters of both the semantic-aware graph neural networks based CD model and the edge differentiation layer.

            "abstract": "Abstract—Cognitive diagnosis is widely applicable in the scenarios where users’ cognitive states need to be assessed, such as games and clinical measurement. Especially in intelligent education, which has become increasingly popular recent decades, cognitive diagnosis serves as a fundamental module for discovering the proﬁciency level of students on speciﬁc knowledge concepts. Existing approaches usually mine linear interactions of student exercising process by manually designed function (e.g., logistic function). However, the cognitive interactions between students and exercises is a complex process, and excessive simpliﬁcations would lead to under ﬁtting and thus get inaccurate diagnostic results. Besides, the manually designed interaction functions are relatively inﬂexible and limits their extensibility. This consequently causes lack of consideration about useful non-numerical information in the cognitive process besides response logs. In this article, we propose a general Neural Cognitive Diagnosis (NeuralCD) framework as well as several implemented models (a basic implementation NeuralCDM and three extensions), where we project students and exercises to factor vectors and incorporates neural networks to learn the complex exercising interactions. To ensure the interpretability of diagnostic results, which is essential for cognitive diagnosis, we apply an monotonicity assumption to our NeuralCD framework. Moreover, NeuralCD is a general framework and has good extensibility. We show the generality of NeuralCD through proving how it can cover some traditional models. Then, we demonstrate the extensibility of NeuralCD, which beneﬁts future developments. On one hand, we demonstrate content-based extensions where we provide examples of exploring the rich contents of exercise texts (CNCD-Q and CNCD-F). On the other hand, we demonstrate a knowledge-association based extension to show that NeuralCD is ﬂexible for structural adjustments so as to solve speciﬁc problems. For instance, we improve the diagnostic results on uncovered knowledge concepts of a student by extending NeuralCD with the knowledge associations consideration (KaNCD).

Additionally, response prediction can be time-consuming. To address these issues, we propose BoxCD, a contrastive probabilistic box embedding model for cognitive diagnosis. BoxCD utilizes high-dimensional axis-aligned hyper-rectangles (boxes) to represent learners and exercises, with the volume of intersecting boxes used to predict learners' responses. This approach effectively captures semantic diversity and uncertainty while enhancing diagnostic effectiveness. To stabilize box embeddings, we integrate contrastive learning objectives with response prediction goals, optimizing the distance between positive and negative samples of learner and exercise boxes to improve uniformity. Additionally, we develop a rank-based response prediction method that leverages the geometric properties of box embeddings to assess learners' response correctness efficiently.

Moreover, we give three implementations of general ECD framework following the typical cognitive diagnosis solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on nearly 52 million records of the students sampled by PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) from 73 countries and regions.

Furthermore, there is a lack of comprehensive modeling for the student-exercise-concept hierarchical relations in CD systems. To this end, in this paper, we present a novel Relation map driven Cognitive Diagnosis (RCD) framework, uniformly modeling the interactive and structural relations via a multi-layer student-exercise-concept relation map.

Then, we leverage a multi-level attention network to integrate node-level relation aggregation inside each local map and balance map-level aggregation across different maps.

Rather than discarding the skills identified by experts, our technique incorporates a nonparametric prior over the exercise-skill assignments that is based on the expert-provided skills and a weighted Chinese restaurant process. We test our technique on datasets from five different intelligent tutoring systems designed for students ranging in age from middle school through college. We obtain two surprising results. First, in three of the five datasets, the skills inferred by our technique support significantly improved predictions of student performance over the expert-provided skills. Second, the expert-provided skills have little value: our technique predicts student performance nearly as well when it ignores the domain expertise as when it attempts to leverage it.

In the first\npart, we explicitly model cognitive process (CP) dimensions from\nBloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, leading to two inno-\nvative concepts proposed: the student’s Subjective Cognitive Abil-\nity (SCA) and the exercise’s Objective Cognitive Attribute (OCA),\nderived by regulating the CP through S-K and E-K interactions, re-\nspectively. Then, the SCA and OCA are formed into a new cognition-\naware latent trait 𝜽. In the second part, we employ a basic interac-\ntion function and a slip and guess influence function, inputting\nour new 𝜽, a continuous Q-matrix (generated by a siamese PLMs),\nand other features to obtain the ideal result, followed by feeding it\ninto the slip and guess influence function to obtain the actual re-\nsult.

Serving as a pivotal module in web-based online intelligent education systems (WOIESs), it plays an upstream and fundamental role in downstream tasks like learning item recommendation and computerized adaptive testing. WOIESs are open learning environment where numerous new students constantly register and complete exercises. In WOIESs, efficient cognitive diagnosis is crucial to fast feedback and accelerating student learning. However, the existing cognitive diagnosis methods always employ intrinsically transductive student-specific embeddings, which become slow and costly due to retraining when dealing with new students who are unseen during training. To this end, this paper proposes an inductive cognitive diagnosis model (ICDM) for fast new students' mastery levels inference in WOIESs. Specifically, in ICDM, we propose a novel student-centered graph (SCG). Rather than inferring mastery levels through updating student-specific embedding, we derive the inductive mastery levels as the aggregated outcomes of students' neighbors in SCG. Namely, SCG enables to shift the task from finding the most suitable student-specific embedding that fits the response logs to finding the most suitable representations for different node types in SCG, and the latter is more efficient since it no longer requires retraining. To obtain this representation, ICDM consists of a construction-aggregation-generation-transformation process to learn the final representation of students, exercises and concepts. Extensive experiments across real-world datasets show that, compared with the existing cognitive diagnosis methods that are always transductive, ICDM is much more faster while maintains the competitive inference performance for new students.",

While existing approaches mitigate this issue by decorrelating sensitive attributes from the modeling process, privacy concerns make collecting such attributes impractical. Furthermore, the presence of multiple sensitive attributes complicates fairness improvements. In this paper, we explore how to achieve fair personalized learner modeling without relying on any sensitive attribute input. We introduce a novel fairness objective tailored for personalized learner modeling and design a max-min strategy to facilitate both sensitive information inference and fair CD modeling. In the max step, we infer pseudo-labels by maximizing the fairness objective, while in the min step, we retrain the CD model by minimizing it.

The primary challenge of DZCD is the deficiency of student behavior data in the target domain due to the absence of student-exercise interactions or unavailability of exercising records for training purposes. To tackle the cold-start issue, we propose a two-stage solution named TechCD (Transferable knowledgE Concept grapH embedding framework for Cognitive Diagnosis). The fundamental notion involves utilizing a pedagogical knowledge concept graph (KCG) as a mediator to connect disparate domains, allowing the transmission of student cognitive signals from established domains to the zero-shot cold-start domain. Specifically, a naive yet effective graph convolutional network (GCN) with the bottom-layer discarding operation is initially employed over the KCG to learn transferable student cognitive states and domain-specific exercise traits. Moreover, we give three implementations of the general TechCD framework following the typical cognitive diagnosis solutions. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets not only prove that Tech can effectively perform zero-shot diagnosis, but also give some popular applications such as exercise recommendation.",

To address this issue, this paper proposes the language representation favored zero-shot cross-domain cognitive diagnosis (LRCD). Specifically, LRCD first analyzes the behavior patterns of students, exercises and concepts in different domains, and then describes the profiles of students, exercises and concepts using textual descriptions.

Moreover, to address the discrepancy between the language space and the cognitive diagnosis space, we propose language-cognitive mappers in LRCD to learn the mapping from the former to the latter. Then, these profiles can be easily and efficiently integrated and trained with existing CDMs. Extensive experiments show that training LRCD on real-world datasets can achieve commendable zero-shot performance across different target domains, and in some cases, it can even achieve competitive performance with some classic CDMs trained on the full response data on target domains.

First, the time complexity would be unbearable when the number of attributes is large. Second, the assumption used to model the attribute hierarchy is too strong so that it may lose some information of the hierarchy and is not flexible enough to fit all situations.

This issue, which we refer to as oversmoothing, could diminish the CDMs' effectiveness in downstream tasks. CDMs comprise two core parts: learning students' mastery levels and assessing mastery levels by fitting the response logs. This paper contends that the oversmoothing issue arises from that existing CDMs seldom utilize response signals on exercises in the learning part but only use them as labels in the assessing part.

Such subtle anomalies can adversely affect the diagnostic results of the models. To address these anomalies, we conduct a qualitative analysis of how anomalous student states and exercise properties impact response outcomes using causal diagrams. We propose a framework named Anomaly Detection for Cognitive Diagnosis (AD4CD) to enhance the ability of Learning-to-Detect-Anomalous. AD4CD approaches the problem from a causal perspective, analyzing confounding paths that affect the true causal relationship between student ability and response outcomes, and designing an anomaly detection mechanism suitable for cognitive diagnostic models. Specifically, we first account for anomalous student behaviors and exercise properties and introduce response times from both students and exercises as modeling factors. By quantifying the response time distributions in high-dimensional features, we identify anomalies within skewed distributions, including both left-tail and right-tail anomalies. Using the detected anomaly scores, we comprehensively model the students' anomalous behaviors and exercise anomalies. Additionally, we reconstruct unbiased true abilities under natural conditions and use reconstruction loss as an anomaly score to assist in modeling guessing and slipping features. Lastly, AD4CD leverages a general cognitive diagnosis model as its backbone, optimizing the guessing and slipping features to provide unbiased and accurate feedback.

            "abstract": "Cognitive Diagnosis has been widely investigated as a fundamental task in the field of education, aiming at effectively assessing the students' knowledge proficiency level by mining their exercise records. Recently, group-level cognitive diagnosis is also attracting attention, which measures the group-level knowledge proficiency on specific concepts by modeling the response behaviors of all students within the classes. However, existing work tends to explore group characteristics with a coarse-grained perspective while ignoring the inter-individual variability within groups, which is prone to unstable diagnosis results. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Homogeneous cohort-aware Group Cognitive Diagnosis model, namely HomoGCD, to effectively model the group's knowledge proficiency level from a multi-grained modeling perspective. Specifically, we first design a homogeneous cohort mining module to explore subgroups of students with similar ability status within a class by modeling their routine exercising performance. Then, we construct the mined cohorts into fine-grained organizations for exploring stable and uniformly distributed features of groups. Subsequently, we develop a multi-grained modeling module to comprehensively learn the cohort and group ability status, which jointly trains both interactions with the exercises. In particular, an extensible diagnosis module is introduced to support the incorporation of different diagnosis functions. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our HomoGCD in group as well as cohort assessments.",

            "abstract": "Learners sharing similar implicit cognitive states often display comparable observable problem-solving performances. Leveraging collaborative connections among such similar learners proves valuable in comprehending human learning. Motivated by the success of collaborative modeling in various domains, such as recommender systems, we aim to investigate how collaborative signals among learners contribute to the diagnosis of human cognitive states (i.e., knowledge proficiency) in the context of intelligent education. The primary challenges lie in identifying implicit collaborative connections and disentangling the entangled cognitive factors of learners for improved explainability and controllability in learner Cognitive Diagnosis (CD). However, there has been no work on CD capable of simultaneously modeling collaborative and disentangled cognitive states. To address this gap, we present Coral, a Collaborative cognitive diagnosis model with disentangled representation learning. Specifically, Coral first introduces a disentangled state encoder to achieve the initial disentanglement of learners' states. Subsequently, a meticulously designed collaborative representation learning procedure captures collaborative signals. It dynamically constructs a collaborative graph of learners by iteratively searching for optimal neighbors in a context-aware manner. Using the constructed graph, collaborative information is extracted through node representation learning. Finally, a decoding process aligns the initial cognitive states and collaborative states, achieving co-disentanglement with practice performance reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Coral, showcasing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across several real-world datasets.

            "abstract": "Abstract—Cognitive diagnosis has been widely recognized as a crucial task in the ﬁeld of computational education, which is capable of learning the knowledge proﬁles of students and predicting their future exercise performance. Indeed, considerable research efforts have been made in this direction over the past decades. However, most of the existing studies only focus on individual-level diagnostic modeling, while the group-level cognitive diagnosis still lacks an in-depth exploration, which is more compatible with realistic collaborative learning environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Relation-guided Dual-side Graph Transformer (RDGT) model for achieving effective group-level cognitive diagnosis. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst construct the dual-side relation graphs (i.e., student-side and exercise-side) from the group-student-exercise heterogeneous interaction data for explicitly modeling associations between students and exercises, respectively. In particular, the edge weight between two nodes is deﬁned based on the similarity of corresponding student-exercise interactions. Then, we introduce two relation-guided graph transformers to learn the representations of students and exercises by integrating the whole graph information, including both nodes and edge weights. Meanwhile, the inter-group information has been incorporated into the student-side relation graph to further enhance the representations of students. Along this line, we design a cognitive diagnosis module for learning the groups' proﬁciency in speciﬁc knowledge concepts, which includes an attention-based aggregation strategy to obtain the ﬁnal group representation and a hybrid loss for optimizing the performance prediction of both group and student. Finally, extensive experiments on 5 real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our model as well as some interesting ﬁndings (e.g., the representative groups and potential collaborations among students).",

            "abstract": "Existing graph learning-based cognitive diagnosis (CD) methods have made relatively good results, but their student, exercise, and concept representations are learned and exchanged in an implicit unified graph, which makes the interaction-agnostic exercise and concept representations be learned poorly, failing to provide high robustness against noise in students' interactions. Besides, lower-order exercise latent representations obtained in shallow layers are not well explored when learning the student representation. To tackle the issues, this paper suggests a meta multigraph-assisted disentangled graph learning framework for CD (DisenGCD), which learns three types of representations on three disentangled graphs: student-exercise-concept interaction, exercise-concept relation, and concept dependency graphs, respectively. Specifically, the latter two graphs are first disentangled from the interaction graph. Then, the student representation is learned from the interaction graph by a devised meta multigraph learning module; multiple learnable propagation paths in this module enable current student latent representation to access lower-order exercise latent representations, which can lead to more effective nad robust student representations learned; the exercise and concept representations are learned on the relation and dependency graphs by graph attention modules. Finally, a novel diagnostic function is devised to handle three disentangled representations for prediction. Experiments show better performance and robustness of DisenGCD than state-of-the-art CD methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled learning framework and meta multigraph module.",

            "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis is a vital upstream task in intelligent education systems. It models the student-exercise interaction, aiming to infer the students' proficiency levels on each knowledge concept. This paper observes that most existing methods can hardly effectively capture the homogeneous influence due to its inherent complexity. That is to say, although students exhibit similar performance on given exercises, their proficiency levels inferred by these methods vary significantly, resulting in shortcomings in interpretability and efficacy. Given the complexity of homogeneous influence, a hypergraph could be a choice due to its flexibility and capability of modeling high-order similarity which aligns with the nature of homogeneous influence. However, before incorporating hypergraph, one at first needs to address the challenges of distorted homogeneous influence, sparsity of response logs, and over-smoothing. To this end, this paper proposes a hypergraph cognitive diagnosis model (HyperCDM) to address these challenges and effectively capture the homogeneous influence. Specifically, to avoid distortion, HyperCDM employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to learn student, exercise and knowledge representations in their own hypergraphs respectively, and interconnects them via a feature-based interaction function. To construct hypergraphs based on sparse response logs, the auto-encoder is utilized to preprocess response logs and 𝐾-means is applied to cluster students. To mitigate over-smoothing, momentum hypergraph convolution networks are designed to partially keep previous representations during the message propagation. Extensive experiments on both offline and online real-world datasets show that HyperCDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of interpretability and capturing homogeneous influence effectively, and is competitive in generalization. The ablation study verifies the efficacy of each component, and the case study explicitly showcases the homogeneous influence captured by HyperCDM.",

            "abstract": "Intelligent education stands as a prominent application of machine learning. Within this domain, cognitive diagnosis (CD) is a key research focus that aims to diagnose students' proficiency levels in specific knowledge concepts. As a crucial task within the field of education, cognitive diagnosis encompasses two fundamental requirements: accuracy and fairness. Existing studies have achieved significant success by primarily utilizing observed historical logs of student-exercise interactions. However, real-world scenarios often present a challenge, where a substantial number of students engage with a limited number of exercises. This data sparsity issue can lead to both inaccurate and unfair diagnoses. To this end, we introduce a monotonic data augmentation framework, CMCD, to tackle the data sparsity issue and thereby achieve accurate and fair CD results. Specifically, CMCD integrates the monotonicity assumption, a fundamental educational principle in CD, to establish two constraints for data augmentation. These constraints are general and can be applied to the majority of CD backbones. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to guarantee the accuracy and convergence speed of CMCD. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets showcase the efficacy of our framework in addressing the data sparsity issue with accurate and fair CD results.",
